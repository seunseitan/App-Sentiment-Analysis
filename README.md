- Sentiments-Ratings Relationship Exploration: Investigate the relationship between the sentiments expressed in reviews and the ratings provided by users. This analysis aids in determining whether there's a correlation between sentiment and rating.

- Text Analysis for Common Themes: Analyze the text of reviews to identify common themes or frequently occurring words within different sentiment categories. This step provides deeper insights into user sentiments.

- Actionable Insights: The results of the sentiment analysis can be utilized to make informed decisions aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and overall usability of the app. This may involve implementing feature updates, addressing issues highlighted in negative reviews, or leveraging positive feedback to reinforce app strengths.
